00:23.237 --> 00:27.006
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...


00:28.091 --> 00:29.876
...friendo?


00:31.111 --> 00:35.131
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?


00:35.232 --> 00:38.601
I was just passing the time.


00:38.786 --> 00:42.972
If you don't want to accept that, I
don't know what else I can do for you.


00:45.810 --> 00:49.328
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?


00:55.519 --> 00:57.587

you're talking about, do you?


01:29.136 --> 01:30.887
Sir?


01:30.988 --> 01:35.258
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.


01:37.261 --> 01:39.562
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?


01:39.663 --> 01:43.883
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I
said, what time do you go to bed?


01:45.369 --> 01:47.803
Oh.


01:47.904 --> 01:51.757
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.


01:51.858 --> 01:51.757
I could come back then.


01:51.858 --> 01:55.761
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.


01:55.812 --> 01:58.498
Yeah, you said that.


01:58.515 --> 02:04.020
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?


02:04.121 --> 02:07.856
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?


02:08.976 --> 02:13.012
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.


02:13.113 --> 02:16.782
[CHOKES] You married into it?


02:16.883 --> 02:21.738
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.


02:21.839 --> 02:24.724
Raised a family there.
In Temple.


02:24.942 --> 02:28.878
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?


02:28.979 --> 02:31.264
If that's the way
you want to put it.


02:31.365 --> 02:34.283
Well, I don't have
some way to put it.


02:34.384 --> 02:36.269
That's the way it is.


02:43.827 --> 02:46.846
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?


02:46.947 --> 02:51.967
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?


02:52.068 --> 02:55.955
Oh, I don't know.
I couldn't say.


02:58.509 --> 03:00.059
- Call it.
- Call it?


03:00.160 --> 03:02.328
- Yes.
- For what?


03:02.429 --> 03:04.163
Just call it.


03:06.183 --> 03:09.952
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.


03:10.053 --> 03:13.206
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.


03:13.307 --> 03:16.626
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.


03:16.727 --> 03:20.313
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.


03:20.414 --> 03:22.431
You just didn't know it.


03:22.532 --> 03:25.551
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.


03:25.786 --> 03:30.039
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.


03:30.140 --> 03:34.961
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.


03:35.062 --> 03:36.462
You have to say. Call it.


03:36.563 --> 03:39.815
Well, look, I need to know
what I stand to win.


03:39.917 --> 03:42.868
- Everything.
- How's that?


03:42.969 --> 03:45.772
You stand to win everything.
Call it.


03:49.743 --> 03:53.412
All right. Heads, then.


03:57.884 --> 03:59.285
Well done.


04:00.938 --> 04:03.088
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?


04:03.190 --> 04:06.726
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.


04:06.827 --> 04:08.411
Where do you want me to put it?


04:08.512 --> 04:10.329
Anywhere not in your pocket.


04:10.430 --> 04:15.218
Or it'll get mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.


04:18.238 --> 04:19.822
Which it is.
