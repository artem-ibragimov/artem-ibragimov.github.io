"Fischerweise, " Schubert, 1826.


00:30.120 --> 00:33.874
- "Give up your foolish trickery. "
- "This fish you cannot cheat. "


00:34.416 --> 00:35.751
I hope I'm not intruding.


00:37.211 --> 00:39.546
Excuse me. Matthew,
take these up to Mr. Williams.


00:39.713 --> 00:41.799
And make sure he packs
my white tie and tails.


00:41.965 --> 00:44.760
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.


00:44.927 --> 00:48.931
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?


00:49.098 --> 00:51.433
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?


00:51.600 --> 00:55.395
No, but might I trouble you
for an inscription?


01:13.580 --> 01:17.084
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.


01:17.251 --> 01:18.627
How was the service?


01:18.794 --> 01:18.627
Definitive.


01:18.794 --> 01:24.341
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.


01:26.093 --> 01:28.637
I trust you'll take this into consideration.


01:32.474 --> 01:35.561
And what considerations
will you grant me?


01:43.735 --> 01:45.237
Have you actually read the book?


01:45.404 --> 01:47.573
I found it compelling...


01:47.739 --> 01:52.035
...though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.


01:52.870 --> 01:55.664
I take that as a compliment.


01:55.831 --> 01:58.709
I have the utmost regard for your talents.


01:59.668 --> 02:02.963
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...


02:04.006 --> 02:05.090
...officially.


02:08.844 --> 02:12.014
Are you familiar with the study
of graphology?


02:12.347 --> 02:14.933
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.


02:15.100 --> 02:18.687
The psychological analysis
of handwriting.


02:18.854 --> 02:23.650
The upward strokes on the P, the J,
and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.


02:24.109 --> 02:26.028
While the flourishes on the lower zone...


02:26.195 --> 02:29.239
...denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.


02:29.406 --> 02:32.743
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...


02:32.910 --> 02:37.372
...there's a suggestion of acute narcissism,
a complete lack of empathy...


02:37.539 --> 02:40.083
- ... and a pronounced inclination toward-
- No.


02:40.250 --> 02:41.668
- moral insanity.


02:42.794 --> 02:47.758
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...


02:47.925 --> 02:50.594
...the answer is no.


02:52.095 --> 02:57.601
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...


02:58.226 --> 03:02.105
...there is always damage
of a collateral nature.


03:04.316 --> 03:06.526
<i>Exempli gratia.</i>


03:06.693 --> 03:10.822
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.


03:12.574 --> 03:15.535
<i>A young woman torn between them.</i>


03:17.079 --> 03:20.666
<i>The strain proves too much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...</i>


03:21.375 --> 03:25.921
...with tragic consequences.


03:28.548 --> 03:32.094
<i>A rare form of tuberculosis.</i>


03:32.260 --> 03:35.889
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.


03:38.809 --> 03:40.185
Now...


03:42.062 --> 03:44.564
...are you sure you want
to play this game?


03:46.191 --> 03:48.735
I'm afraid you'd lose.


03:50.654 --> 03:56.493
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...


03:56.660 --> 03:58.954
...I shall do the same to you.


03:59.413 --> 04:04.668
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.


04:06.878 --> 04:08.630
You've paid me several compliments.


04:08.797 --> 04:13.802
Let me pay you one in return when I say that
if I were assured of the former eventuality...


04:16.805 --> 04:19.057
...I would cheerfully accept the latter.


04:22.936 --> 04:26.481
I'll be sure to send my regards
to the happy couple.
