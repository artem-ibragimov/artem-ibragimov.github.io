1
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>The year was 1891.</i>

2
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.</i>

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>France and Germany
were at each other's throats...</i>

4
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>...the result of a series of bombings.</i>

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>Some said it was Nationalists...</i>

6
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>...others, the anarchists.</i>

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>But as usual...</i>

8
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,350
<i>...my friend Sherlock Holmes...</i>

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>...had a different theory entirely.</i>

10
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,529
<i>Bombing in Strasbourg! Read all about it!</i>

11
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,365
Thank you.
Anarchists suspected...

12
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,993
...in Strasbourg bombing!

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,338
Bombing in Strasbourg!

14
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,208
When did you start working
for the postal service?

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,378
That was you back there.

16
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,173
Shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter.

17
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,468
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?

18
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,720
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

19
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,930
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm. I'm not.

20
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,600
How about the Savoy, 8:00?

21
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,809
- Splendid.
- Hmm.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,728
And will you be coming as yourself?

23
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,105
Most likely.

24
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,567
Three men have been following you
for the last half mile...

25
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,694
...their motives highly unsavory.

26
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,990
No.

27
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,919
Oh, and, by the way, they're not
pursuing me, they're escorting me.

28
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,048
And instead of three,
there seems to be, uh, four.

29
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,257
Heh.

30
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,552
Steady hands with that, Irene.

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,764
Oh, I don't think it's my hands
you have to worry about.

32
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,934
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.

33
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,477
Don't fill up on bread.

34
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,295
I forgot the rest.

35
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,676
Oh, it's coming back now.

36
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,990
Aah!

37
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,200
Aah!

38
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,832
Peelers!

39
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,904
We now come to Lot 34...

40
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,909
...Egyptian sarcophagus
of outstanding provenance...

41
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,078
...retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

42
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,455
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.

43
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,748
Who will bid...

44
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,208
...100 pounds?

45
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,502
One hundred. Thank you, sir.

46
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,090
Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.

47
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,052
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

48
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,601
Uh--
 Stay...

49
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,603
...while I check the contents.

50
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,232
I was assured full payment
would be there.

51
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,193
Yes, but assured by whom?

52
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,112
Have you ever met him in person?

53
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,657
Or like me, have you been-?

54
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,743
Hold it, hold it. Please, don't move it.

55
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,580
Judging from size and weight,
it's not the payment you were expecting.

56
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,709
I'd wager the contents
are rather more incendiary.

57
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,211
- Who is this?
- It's...

58
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,421
Hello, darling.

59
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,972
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it. It seems
a secondary charge has been activated.

60
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,183
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

61
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,105
One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.

62
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,232
- Well, good luck.
One million pounds.

63
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,446
Oh, and by the way, fire.

64
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,822
Fire!

65
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,413
Leave my side,
you'll be dead in an hour.

66
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,123
And don't be late for dinner.

67
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,418
My schedule will be quite tight
because of these activities here.

68
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,339
- I've never been late in my life, only early.
- Fashionably.

69
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,341
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm!

70
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,260
Very witty. So confident, even in retreat.

71
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,555
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.

72
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,225
Fine. Dinner and a show.

73
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,024
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

74
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,695
Herr Hoffmanstahl,
you should count yourself lucky.

75
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,533
This faceless man with whom you find
yourself in business is no ordinary criminal.

76
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,330
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

77
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,750
I'm a consulting detective
of some repute.

78
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,628
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock...

79
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,548
...Holmes.

80
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,758
Hyah!

81
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,221
A fresh pot of tea. Thank you, George.

82
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,181
Yes, Miss Adler.

83
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,644
Fine choice, this place.

84
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,856
Do you have the letter?

85
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,024
It was taken.

86
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,028
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

87
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,118
During the chaos created
by your package.

88
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,286
Thank you.

89
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,959
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

90
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,379
You wish to know my plans now,
do you?

91
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,008
Did you imagine, Miss Adler,
that something would happen to you?

92
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,052
Is that why you chose to meet here
in a public place?

93
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,471
Your favorite restaurant?

94
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,880
I don't blame you.

95
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,550
I blame myself.

96
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,473
It's been apparent to me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

97
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:05,313
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes
has inconvenienced me in recent months.

98
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,024
The question is...

99
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,653
...what to do about it.

100
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,454
But that's my problem to solve now.

101
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,710
I no longer require your services.

102
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,385
Mrs. Hudson?

103
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,306
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

104
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,019
Holmes, you in there?

105
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,029
Your hedge needs trimming.

106
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,117
Where am I?

107
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,162
I don't care where you are
as long as you're ready.

108
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,210
I'm waiting.

109
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm not gonna play this game.

110
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,011
Remember, I have to catch the last...

111
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,059
- ... train.
Uh-oh.

112
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,229
- That's you dead, I'm afraid.
- You win.

113
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,110
I lose. Game over.

114
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,988
Still don't see me?

115
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,875
I'm not going out with you
dressed like that.

116
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,255
Would you prefer I joined you
in the fashion faux pas...

117
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,633
...of wearing fine military dress
with that heinous handmade scarf...

118
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,177
...clearly one of your fiancee's
early efforts?

119
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,513
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

120
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,266
Have you? Why?

121
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,311
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

122
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,314
Extracting fluids from
the adrenal glands of sheep...

123
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,192
...and designing
my own urban camouflage...

124
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,903
...all the while verging
on a decisive breakthrough...

125
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,408
...in the single most important case
of my career, perhaps of all time.

126
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,786
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

127
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,915
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

128
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,710
And thank you for looking after
Gladstone.

129
00:13:55,877 --> 00:14:01,841
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny,
might I have a word?

130
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,554
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

131
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,806
You feed it.

132
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,435
Touchy, touchy.

133
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,105
Doctor, you must get him
to a sanatorium.

134
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,400
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco,
and coca leaves.

135
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,696
He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices
as if he's rehearsing a play.

136
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,702
- Leave him to me.
- Don't you have a goat that needs worming?

137
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,330
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

138
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,501
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?

139
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,670
Good luck with your patient, doctor.

140
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,964
Why are you here?

141
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,176
I'm getting married tomorrow.

142
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,429
Oh! Embrace me.

143
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,516
Watson's getting married.

144
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,061
- You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
- Yes, and you've picked them up.

145
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,272
- Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.
- Ha.

146
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,317
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.

147
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,655
It is our last adventure, Watson.

148
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,865
I intend to make the most of it.

149
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,754
I see you've made good use
of my old office.

150
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,674
Do you like my spider's web?
Is that what you call it?

151
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,592
Follow that strand.

152
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,348
Question: What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon...

153
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,600
...the overdose of
a Chinese opium trader...

154
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,769
...bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...

155
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,398
...and the death of a steel magnate
in America all have in common?

156
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:48,030
Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.

157
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
Indeed.

158
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,453
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.

159
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,205
Boxing champion at Cambridge...

160
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,333
...where he made friends
with our current prime minister.

161
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,211
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

162
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,301
This. Now do you see?

163
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,680
Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
- Yes.

164
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,182
I've heard you speak of him,
extolling his virtues.

165
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,145
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

166
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,815
Just the other day, I averted
an explosion that was intended for him.

167
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,110
Says here he died of a heart attack.

168
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,698
Has all my instruction been for naught? You
still read the official statement and believe it.

169
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,242
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

170
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,288
We're playing cat and mouse,
the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

171
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,457
I thought it was spider and fly?

172
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

173
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
Not a mouse, but a dagger.

174
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,756
You're drinking embalming fluid.

175
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,593
Ooh. Yes. Care for a drop?

176
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,053
You do seem-

177
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,262
- Excited?
- Manic.

178
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,430
- I am.
- Verging on-

179
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,057
- Ecstatic?
- Psychotic.

180
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,978
- Should've brought a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise.

181
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,441
He must be stopped before
his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

182
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,901
And how will he do all this?

183
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,863
Don't be a dingy bird. Bad people
do bad things because they can.

184
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,117
No one, not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone-

185
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,912
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
- Correct.

186
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,414
- ... on this diet, will work it all out.
- Right.

187
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,334
- Or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts, not quite there.

188
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,628
Here's to your good health.

189
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,589
Dingy bird.

190
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,179
What have you done to Gladstone now?

191
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,225
<i>Ricinus communis.
The fruit is highly toxic.</i>

192
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,810
He's barely breathing.

193
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,896
What an excellent opportunity.

194
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,231
This may be just the thing.

195
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,860
Sorry, do you mind terribly
if I try my adrenal extract?

196
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,488
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

197
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,410
Took off like a monkey from a box.

198
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,204
- Hmm.
- I may need one of those in a few hours.

199
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,956
Consider it a wedding gift.

200
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,460
Watson, might we use
an alternative exit?

201
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,964
Is there something different about you?

202
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,174
I'm under observation.

203
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,218
As you should be.

204
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,761
You drive.

205
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,768
Will your beard be with us all night?

206
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,439
I'll remove it once
we're south of Trafalgar Square.

207
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,192
If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

208
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,069
...isn't this a bit conspicuous?

209
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,531
It's so overt, it's covert.

210
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,538
Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.

211
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,798
Why are you looking at me
with such concern?

212
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,595
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.

213
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,515
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.

214
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,975
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.

215
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,643
- Restriction.
- Structure.

216
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,480
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.

217
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,984
A life in matrimony,
the possibility of a family.

218
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,778
Who wants to die alone?

219
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,989
We'll have a good old-fashioned
romp tonight...

220
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,659
...you'll settle down, have a family,
and I'll die alone.

221
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,162
Yes, that's about it.

222
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:30,711
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

223
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,591
Anyway...

224
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,931
Not bad, that.

225
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,933
So where are we going?

226
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,686
In the future, there'll be one of
those machines in every town in Europe.

227
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,397
Loitering in the woodshed again,
are we, Myccie?

228
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,775
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.

229
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,611
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

230
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,907
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

231
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,284
The chimney in the front room
at Baker Street...

232
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,286
...still needs a damn good sweeping up.

233
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,290
Were you aware that the hackney carriage
by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

234
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,210
Yes, the left.
And it's plain to the meanest intelligence...

235
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,797
...that you have recently
acquired a new bow for your violin.

236
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,674
Same bow, new strings.

237
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,219
And may I deduce, Mycroft-?
Good evening, by the way.

238
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,637
No.

239
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,682
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...

240
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:30,020
...who rarely strays from the path that runs
from your home to the Diogenes Club...

241
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,774
...and never on a Monday when
they serve your favorite potted shrimps...

242
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:38,904
...must be here for some far more important
reason than my stag party?

243
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:44,994
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted
as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

244
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,871
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...

245
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:52,209
...but with all the conflict in Europe
at the moment, the whole situation could-

246
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,545
Excuse me. -suddenly erupt.

247
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,632
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

248
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,469
If the concerns of two nations...

249
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,597
...which shall remain nameless...

250
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,143
...but I can tell you they speak
French and German...

251
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,813
...are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...

252
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,358
...to attend the ghastly peace summit
in Reichenbach.

253
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,861
The worst thing about Switzerland
is the altitude.

254
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,280
It gives me nosebleeds,
exacerbates my asthma...

255
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,742
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

256
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,300
This looks promising.

257
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,761
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

258
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,597
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.

259
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,766
Perhaps a good cigar.

260
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,561
And don't bother with the chairs.

261
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,397
What is it your brother does exactly?

262
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,359
He's the keeper
of the broom cupboard of state.

263
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,236
No ambition, no energy...

264
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,198
...yet I'm repeatedly told that he's
indispensable to the British government...

265
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,991
...particularly the Foreign Office.

266
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,869
- I would like to propose a toast.
- Really?

267
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,914
To my dear friend, Dr. John...

268
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,627
...um, Hamish Watson-

269
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm right here.

270
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,590
- on the eve of his wedding. He...

271
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,135
...has been the best companion.

272
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,013
Shouldn't we be waiting
for the boys from my rugby club?

273
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,599
He has always kept us-
They couldn't attend.

274
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,726
- flat-footed on the ground.

275
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,979
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?

276
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,231
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?

277
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,110
- No man's better worth having at your side-
- Who is it you're looking for?

278
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,862
Because I don't know a single
damn person here, do I?

279
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,573
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

280
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,910
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?

281
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,248
You completely forgot about my stag party,
didn't you?

282
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,086
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.

283
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,380
Shame none of your friends
could make it.

284
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,890
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

285
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,227
- Give me my money.
- Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

286
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,397
So now you're interested
in being the best man.

287
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,983
You're supposed to keep
the ring anyway.

288
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,777
Just as you're supposed to
organize my stag party.

289
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,613
- Don't want to lose it on a bet.
- And invite my friends...

290
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,451
...of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...

291
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,953
...Sherly No Mates.

292
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,752
He's all "me, me, me, " isn't he?

293
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,472
I win!

294
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,234
Please, sit.

295
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,154
Put your money on the table
and we will begin.

296
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,788
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

297
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,921
Cards can illuminate your past...

298
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,508
...clarify your present,
and show you the future.

299
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,555
If you have a specific question,
hold it in your mind.

300
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,140
Mm.

301
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,149
I'm holding.

302
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,069
Let me know when you're ready.

303
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,738
Actually, I'd prefer to read...

304
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,323
...your fortune.

305
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,288
Temperance inverted.

306
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,666
Indicative of volatility.

307
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,753
A woman who has recently
taken her comfort in drink.

308
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,298
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

309
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,386
- A fool embarrassing himself?
- Hmm.

310
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,931
- Hmm.
- Oh, yes. The Fool.

311
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,935
Someone has been led astray, involved
in something without their knowledge.

312
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,814
Not bad,
but you have to make me believe you.

313
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,399
I have to see it in your eyes.

314
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,277
- Right. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.

315
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,447
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

316
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,700
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?

317
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,079
And I see a name. Yes, it's...

318
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,081
...Rene.

319
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,251
What do you want?

320
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,794
The Devil.

321
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,509
Why are we playing this game?

322
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,478
Where did you get this?

323
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,900
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but I believe it was intended for you.

324
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,449
SIM

325
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,250
"Found my purpose in life. "

326
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,713
So the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

327
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,219
Time is up.

328
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,013
I have other clients.

329
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,396
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

330
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,649
...snagged on a nail
over my left shoulder...

331
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,693
...you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

332
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,820
...of herring pickled in vodka...

333
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,865
...in tandem with
a truly unfortunate body odor.

334
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,244
There's a man concealed
in the rafters above us.

335
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,039
A Cossack, renowned for
their infeasible acrobatic abilities...

336
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,668
...and are notorious for moonlighting
as assassins.

337
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:12,047
So it's safe to presume
that your next client is here to kill you.

338
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,841
Anything else? No?

339
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,101
<i>First, pillage the nest.</i>

340
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,564
<i>Clip wings.</i>

341
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,235
<i>Now blunt his beak.</i>

342
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,533
<i>Crack eggs.</i>

343
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,954
<i>Scramble. Pinch of salt.</i>

344
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>Touch of pepper.</i>

345
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,965
<i>Flip the omelet.</i>

346
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,722
<i>Additional seasoning required.</i>

347
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,226
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

348
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,493
Come with me. I need you alive. Now.

349
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,581
Oh!

350
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,175
Aah!

351
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,817
Didn't see that in the cards, did you?

352
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,030
Oh...

353
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,713
Coming down, folks, coming down.

354
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,675
Looks like we've got ourselves
our next cockfight.

355
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,098
Five, four, three, two, one...

356
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,766
...let him go!

357
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,335
Get up there!

358
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,221
All mine?

359
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
Now, wait a minute.

360
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,449
You're right. He did stink.

361
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,451
Hey, you can run-

362
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,703
Where's you?

363
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,166
Just had a fight.

364
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,795
- Just had a fight.
- Yes.

365
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,588
- Where were you?
- I'm glad to see...

366
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,341
...you're taking your best-man duties
so seriously.

367
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,178
I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!

368
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,763
She was biting my leg.

369
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,475
I'll have Carruthers put some fuel
into that motor carriage of yours.

370
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,310
You do have a wedding to attend.

371
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,687
Oh, I'll drive.

372
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,146
Hmm.

373
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,609
Ho-honk. Ha-ha-ha.

374
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,405
Let's have another drink.
- No, no, I think you've had quite enough.

375
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,943
Present arms!

376
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,099
I've been to a wedding here before.

377
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,770
Funeral too.

378
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,692
The professor wants to meet.

379
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,655
I'd expected to hear from him sooner,
in light of recent events.

380
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:21,035
He was wondering if it'd be convenient for
you to come by the college this afternoon.

381
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,371
His lecture concludes at 4.

382
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,539
Looking forward.

383
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,500
One side, chummy.

384
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,571
"Fischerweise, " Schubert, 1826.

385
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,874
- "Give up your foolish trickery. "
- "This fish you cannot cheat. "

386
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,751
I hope I'm not intruding.

387
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,546
Excuse me. Matthew,
take these up to Mr. Williams.

388
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,799
And make sure he packs
my white tie and tails.

389
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,760
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.

390
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,931
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

391
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,433
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?

392
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,395
No, but might I trouble you
for an inscription?

393
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,084
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

394
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,627
How was the service?

395
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,045
Definitive.

396
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,341
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.

397
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,637
I trust you'll take this into consideration.

398
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,561
And what considerations
will you grant me?

399
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,237
Have you actually read the book?

400
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,573
I found it compelling...

401
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,035
...though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.

402
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,664
I take that as a compliment.

403
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,709
I have the utmost regard for your talents.

404
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,963
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

405
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,090
...officially.

406
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,014
Are you familiar with the study
of graphology?

407
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,933
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.

408
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,687
The psychological analysis
of handwriting.

409
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:57,650
The upward strokes on the P, the J,
and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.

410
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,028
While the flourishes on the lower zone...

411
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,239
...denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.

412
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,743
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

413
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,372
...there's a suggestion of acute narcissism,
a complete lack of empathy...

414
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
- ... and a pronounced inclination toward-
- No.

415
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,668
- moral insanity.

416
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:21,758
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...

417
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,594
...the answer is no.

418
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:31,601
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...

419
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:36,105
...there is always damage
of a collateral nature.

420
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,526
<i>Exempli gratia.</i>

421
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,822
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.

422
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,535
<i>A young woman torn between them.</i>

423
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,666
<i>The strain proves too much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...</i>

424
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,921
...with tragic consequences.

425
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,094
<i>A rare form of tuberculosis.</i>

426
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,889
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

427
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,185
Now...

428
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,564
...are you sure you want
to play this game?

429
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,735
I'm afraid you'd lose.

430
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:30,493
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...

431
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,954
...I shall do the same to you.

432
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:38,668
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.

433
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,630
You've paid me several compliments.

434
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:47,802
Let me pay you one in return when I say that
if I were assured of the former eventuality...

435
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,057
...I would cheerfully accept the latter.

436
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,481
I'll be sure to send my regards
to the happy couple.

437
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,696
Another time, then.

438
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,552
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

439
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,970
Which coach are we?

440
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,889
We should be just here.

441
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,767
Ooh.

442
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,769
First class.

443
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,232
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

444
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,486
Hurry up, Dr. Watson,
your wife needs you.

445
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,821
Coming, Mrs. Watson.

446
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,868
Ooh. First class, champagne.

447
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,537
You do know how to spoil a girl,
Mr. Watson.

448
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,122
You're not just any girl.

449
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the
lavatory while the train's in the station.

450
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,217
You're Mrs. Watson.

451
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,553
Give me that bottle.

452
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,071
John, there is nowhere else in the world
I would rather be.

453
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,990
There's no one I'd rather be with.

454
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,576
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

455
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,788
Heh. Old habits.

456
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,293
Ahem. Come in.

457
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,798
- Oh, yes, please.
- We didn't order that.

458
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,216
With our compliments, sir.

459
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,177
Thank you. Put it there.

460
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,985
Open the door, John.

461
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,615
I think it's time for you to leave.

462
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,665
Sit down.

463
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,504
Shh.

464
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,735
I agree it's not my best disguise,
but I had to make do.

465
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,238
- My God.
- They'll be back.

466
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,824
- John, shut the door.
- They'll only shoot through it.

467
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,452
He's right, you know.
- Oh, my God.

468
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,747
- I understand.
- Do you?

469
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,249
Terribly inconvenient.

470
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,668
We don't have much time.

471
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,093
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen.

472
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,679
Who are they?
- A wedding present from Moriarty.

473
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,724
Lovely ceremony, by the way.
Many a tear shed in joy.

474
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh, John?

475
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,478
Yeah, just a minute, darling.

476
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,980
- Do you trust me?
- No.

477
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,817
Well, then I shall have
to do something about that.

478
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,743
Who's up to bat next, you bastards?

479
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,788
Send out the fast bowler!

480
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,456
John, do shut the door.

481
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,713
It had to be done.

482
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,675
She's safe now.

483
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,346
In my own defense, I timed it perfectly.

484
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,808
Did you kill my wife?!

485
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,103
Did you just kill my new wife?!

486
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,105
Of course not!

487
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,527
What do you mean? How do you know that
when you just threw her off a train?

488
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,904
I told you, I timed it perfectly.

489
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,281
What does that mean?!

490
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,161
- Calm down.
- Explain!

491
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,497
By the time I've explained,
we'd both be dead!

492
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,346
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory
while the train's in the station.

493
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,151
That was no accident.

494
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,030
It was by design.

495
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:48,120
Now, do you need me to elaborate...

496
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,999
...or can we just crack on?

497
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,341
Come on!

498
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,763
Don't worry, old boy,
she's as safe as houses.

499
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,015
She's with my brother.

500
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,143
I'm on my honeymoon!

501
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,522
Why did you lead them here?!
Why did you involve us?!

502
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,774
They aren't here for me!
They're here for you!

503
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,740
Fortunately...

504
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,207
...so am I.

505
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,750
Now mind the door.

506
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,837
Good evening.

507
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,425
I think you'll find that second class
is more comfortable.

508
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,553
The coast is clear.

509
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,221
To the south, quick march.

510
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,231
Lie down with me, Watson.

511
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,234
- Why?
- I insist.

512
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,868
What are we doing down here?

513
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,246
We are waiting. I am smoking.

514
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,436
- Patiently waiting.
- For what?

515
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,398
Your window of opportunity.

516
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,531
Make it count.

517
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:59,126
I said make it count.
How many windows must I provide?

518
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,567
Who'd have known that honeymooning
in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

519
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,444
Is that what this is about?

520
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,030
By your own admission,
you've never enjoyed it there.

521
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,782
I've never been to Brighton.

522
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,826
Or you're just too fragile
to remember at present.

523
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,787
Oh, shut up.

524
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,163
Tell me my wife's safe.

525
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,040
I can't do both.

526
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,627
I promise. As I said, I timed it perfectly.

527
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,345
Over here, madam!

528
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,975
I believe congratulations are in order,
Mrs. Watson.

529
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,563
I'm the other Holmes.

530
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,941
You mean there's two of you?

531
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,819
How marvelous.
Could this evening get any better?

532
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,238
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

533
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,741
Excellent question.
The answer is twofold.

534
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,827
He's after us because of you.

535
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,788
I'm afraid you must bear
half the responsibility.

536
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,374
- Here it comes. So predictable.
- Had you and Mary...

537
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:23,502
...not been hell-bent on wedding,
we could've solved this case.

538
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,213
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- The argument could be made...

539
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,049
- No, it couldn't.
- ... that your nuptials were poorly timed.

540
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,928
Thus, our relationship-

541
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,306
Relationship?

542
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,599
Very well, partnership.

543
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,853
- has not yet run its course.

544
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,065
My dear fellow, if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end...

545
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,819
...I shall never again ask you
to assist me.

546
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,410
Once more unto the breach.

547
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,871
That's the spirit. Now, to the question.

548
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,041
This is so deliciously complicated.
You may be asking yourself...

549
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:06,211
...what does a criminal mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

550
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,673
It's her brother, I tell you.
When we find him, and we must-

551
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,425
After you find my luggage.

552
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,553
Go on.

553
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,388
Wait.

554
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,307
Where is it we're going?

555
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,436
Paris, the most sensible
honeymoon destination of all.

556
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,962
- So why Paris?
- Peaches.

557
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,714
Outside the city at Montreuil...

558
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:55,719
...there's a Gypsy camp famous
for its dried fruit, especially peaches.

559
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:01,058
And there we shall find
our fortune teller...

560
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,435
...and return her bag.

561
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,889
And my ticket?

562
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,779
Unfortunately,
you won't be needing yours.

563
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:43,410
<i>That's a shame, professor.
I was looking forward to Don Giovanni.</i>

564
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,755
Follow Meinhard.

565
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,379
Wake up, we're here.

566
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,756
Brace yourself.
We're about to be violated.

567
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,925
Don't be so cynical.

568
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,479
- They're taking my luggage.
- Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.

569
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,026
You had her bag.

570
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,112
Now they have my coat.

571
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,615
Where is Madam Simza?

572
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,828
This is Simza.

573
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,794
Sim is a goose.

574
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,797
I am Sim. Ha-ha-ha.

575
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,096
Nice scarf. I like.

576
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,663
- You hungry?
- Famished.

577
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,212
Madam, this is a glorious
hedgehog goulash.

578
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,966
I can't remember ever having had better.

579
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:10,223
Do tell me, when was the last time
you had a hedgehog goulash?

580
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,934
I told you, Watson, I can't remember.

581
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,853
Perhaps you've repressed it.

582
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,650
That's where we differ.
Unlike you, I repress nothing.

583
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,401
Perfectly normal.

584
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,406
How dare you be rude to this woman
who has invited us into her tent...

585
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,158
...offered us her hedgehog?

586
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:32,079
Says the man who throws women
from trains.

587
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,123
Who are you two?

588
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,000
Concerned citizens.

589
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,878
Why did someone try to kill me?

590
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,466
Your brother has become involved
with a very dangerous man...

591
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:48,303
...who clearly believes that Rene has
told you something you shouldn't know.

592
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,598
I don't know anything.

593
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,519
I've been looking for him for over a year.

594
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,813
That was why I was in London.

595
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,566
- It's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you.

596
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,695
He'd never send you a message
that would put you in harm's way.

597
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,573
Any information, therefore,
would be, by default, unintentional.

598
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,826
Has he sent you anything else?

599
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,245
Just a few drawings.

600
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,872
Let's just see what they have to tell us.

601
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:27,050
Unusual choice of paper. Thicker gauge,
designed for a printing press.

602
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,011
- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.

603
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,347
They smell musty.

604
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,101
Must have been stored
somewhere cold and damp.

605
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,812
What's that? Blood?

606
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:44,985
Wine. So a wine cellar located
near a printing press.

607
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,570
That should narrow it down.

608
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,078
There's a wine cellar used
by the anarchist group Lapin Vert.

609
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,622
Rene was close to their leader.

610
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,207
Claude Ravache.

611
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,878
- A bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week.

612
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,133
I was a part of the movement.
So was Rene.

613
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,844
Until it became too extreme for us.

614
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,181
Ravache knows me.

615
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:18,894
If my brother's back there, he will see us.

616
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,187
We will send a message.

617
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,241
Whatever you do,
don't let these gypsies make you drink.

618
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,451
Of course.

619
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,369
You dance?

620
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:40,207
For God's sake, don't dance.
It'll be the death of you.

621
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,130
You know what happens
when you dance.

622
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,284
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.

623
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,495
- Have you had breakfast?
- I-

624
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,413
Stanley here does a wonderful
deviled kidney.

625
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,874
Ahem.

626
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,793
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir.

627
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,379
Telegram for Mrs. Watson.

628
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,011
Uh...

629
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,888
It just doesn't make any sense.

630
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,431
Allow me.

631
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,268
Oh, yes.

632
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:45,772
"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you.
I never wish to see you again.

633
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:50,026
Every moment I count away from you
is a blessing. "

634
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,821
Fret not.
It's a double encryption, my dear...

635
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:56,157
...that Sherly and I
have used since we were boys.

636
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,286
If the first letter of the message
is a consonant...

637
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,497
...then what follows is the mirrored truth.

638
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,957
- I see.
- Hmm.

639
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,460
Stanley!

640
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,548
You know, although our time together
has been but a brief interlude...

641
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:15,969
...I'm beginning to understand
how a man of particular disposition...

642
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:21,057
...under certain circumstances,
extreme ones perhaps...

643
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:25,437
...might grow to enjoy the company of...

644
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:31,610
- ... a person of your gender. Hmm.
- Hmm.

645
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,653
Thank you so much.

646
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,947
Most charming.

647
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,701
May-? Terribly sorry. Thank you.

648
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,413
Where are you going, Stanley?

649
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,973
Whoa, whoa.

650
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,484
Still hiding in basements?

651
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,241
RAVACHE

652
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,705
I'm not here to see you.

653
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,917
Yeah.

654
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,587
RAVACHE

655
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,339
with your English friends.

656
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,512
1789, a seminal vintage.

657
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,764
The year of our glorious revolution.

658
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,434
- Is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny.

659
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,601
Is my brother here?

660
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,230
I haven't seen him for a long time.

661
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,440
You're lying.

662
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,609
Sit, please.

663
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,657
A letter was received from Rene
using this same paper.

664
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,035
Of course.
He took it with him wherever he went.

665
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,288
He's telling the truth. Rene isn't here.

666
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,750
- He was given another assignment by an-
- An anonymous benefactor.

667
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,296
Another Englishman...

668
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,633
...with money, power,
who supported our cause.

669
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,844
And now...

670
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,264
...he dictates our every move...

671
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:16,399
...demanding I take responsibility
for his acts of terror.

672
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,902
I made a deal with the devil.

673
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,904
But after tonight, ahem...

674
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,406
...it will be over.

675
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,118
My job is almost done.

676
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,624
He's had you plant another bomb,
hasn't he?

677
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,417
Claude, please.

678
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,211
These men can help you.

679
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,963
I wish they could.

680
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,591
You see, gentlemen...

681
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,469
...he has my wife and children.

682
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,555
If you tell us where the bomb is...

683
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,017
- ... I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of.

684
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,394
We have a deal.

685
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,149
He and I.

686
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,319
No loose ends.

687
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,156
There's only one thing I can do
to keep my family safe.

688
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,576
- You have less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!

689
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,884
He has no further need of that pistol.
Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?

690
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,711
There's only one way out of this place.

691
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,505
Right you are.

692
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,304
Ah. Ingenious.

693
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,556
That's the one. Quickly as we can.

694
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,312
You know what to do with that sandbag,
Watson.

695
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,814
Quick now.

696
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,073
Doctor, could you secure that lever?

697
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,743
You could have told me.

698
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:36,289
Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty.
He would never take his own life.

699
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,582
Calm yourself.

700
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,715
My brother, he's weak.

701
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,469
Sim, I need you to take a deep breath...

702
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,845
...and follow us.

703
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,224
To the opera.

704
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,547
I was mistaken.

705
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,842
- What?
- I made a mistake.

706
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,621
He took the shot from here.

707
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,250
Using a tripod and a shooting stick.

708
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,295
And realized there was a better position.

709
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:39,926
There's a faint scrape where
he dragged his tripod and set it up here.

710
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,012
- Six hundred yards?
Or 650?

711
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,640
Not to mention a seven-
or eight-mile-an-hour wind.

712
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,309
He would've needed a wind gauge.

713
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,686
Which he placed here.

714
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,274
And put a cigarette down here.

715
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,070
Can anyone shoot that far?

716
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,948
Not more than half a dozen men
in all of Europe.

717
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,076
How many of those men served
in Afghanistan?

718
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,828
Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.

719
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,248
<i>Must have fallen out
when he was rolling up.</i>

720
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,291
Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?

721
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,421
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian Moran.

722
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,758
<i>Best marksman in the British army.</i>

723
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,927
Dishonorable discharge.

724
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:27,765
He's likely now a gun for hire. This is the
second victim of his that I've encountered.

725
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,642
What better way to conceal a killing?

726
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,144
No one looks for a bullet hole
in a bomb blast.

727
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,160
- He's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon.

728
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,371
I don't have any papers.

729
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,707
And I am a foreigner.

730
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,167
This climate is exactly what
Moriarty wants.

731
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:59,088
Ahem.
The omelet fines herbes was divine...

732
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,841
...but they spared every expense
on the tea.

733
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,887
Now shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

734
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,890
<i>Last night's bombing was
clearly meant...</i>

735
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,977
<i>...to look like Germany's retaliation
for Strasbourg.</i>

736
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:16,856
<i>However, the bomb was also meant
to conceal the murder of just one man.</i>

737
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,527
The man killed by the gunshot
was none other than Alfred Meinhard.

738
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:22,987
Ah.

739
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,575
He makes guns. Big guns.

740
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:32,079
Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

741
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,414
Moriarty.

742
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:38,127
The clues point in one direction,
but to avoid repeating last night's debacle...

743
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,173
...I was obliged to collect
more sufficient data, hence my tardiness.

744
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,391
Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.

745
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,783
Whoa!

746
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,378
- Just the bags.
- But...

747
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,506
We have enough time for me
to indulge my little habit.

748
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:24,715
Yes.

749
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:30,054
<i>His habit of feeding that
urban species, the feral pigeon.</i>

750
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,226
So there are seven mainline
railway stations in Paris.

751
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:38,270
But taking 10 minutes to get
to the Jardin des Tuileries...

752
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:42,066
...where the largest concentration
of the winged vermin may be found...

753
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,319
...reduces there to one,
the Gare du Nord...

754
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:50,658
...where he will be just in time
to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

755
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,369
It makes several stops along the way,
one of which is--

756
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,246
Heilbronn.

757
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:58,499
Exactly where we must go.

758
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,459
Where Meinhard's factory is.

759
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,628
It's Moriarty's factory now.

760
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,964
Unfortunately, due to the bombing...

761
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,883
...the crossing between
France and Germany is to be closed.

762
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:12,847
I'm afraid our pursuit is over
unless we can happen upon a comrade...

763
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:16,642
...who knows their way around borders.

764
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,478
Too English.

765
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,150
However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.

766
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,318
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

767
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,280
Now, now, no need to be demeaning.

768
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,657
It is a nice scarf.

769
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,493
No, no, too English. It'll suit you more.

770
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,664
Black one is yours. Gray one is mine.

771
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,792
- And this is for you.
- Urn- Hmm.

772
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,127
Right.

773
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,589
- Where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow.

774
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,174
Can't you ride?

775
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,970
It's not that he can't ride.

776
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,513
How is it you put it, Holmes?

777
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,350
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

778
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,855
Why would I want anything with a mind
of its own bobbing about between my legs?

779
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,524
Then I shall require a bicycle,
thank you very much.

780
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,819
It's 1891. Could've chartered a balloon.

781
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,616
How can we make this more manageable?

782
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,047
Where's the fire?

783
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,892
It's not as if
Germany is going somewhere.

784
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,319
We know another way.

785
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,203
Slow and steady wins the race.

786
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,180
Come on!

787
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:37,783
We slip in through the loading
bay, find out what he's doing...

788
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,743
...and we get out.

789
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,579
Getting out might be tricky.

790
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,163
We will get you out.

791
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,333
If my brother's in there, get him out alive.

792
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,226
Are you happy?

793
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,563
- What?
- At this moment...

794
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,692
...are you as happy as you would be
on your honeymoon in Brighton?

795
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,987
I'm not going to grace that question
with an answer.

796
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,075
- Are you happy?
- I think we're here for another reason.

797
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,452
- Okay.
- Shall we get on-?

798
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,454
- Simple question.
- Will we do something?

799
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,165
- Or wait for them to come back round?
- What time is it?

800
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,542
- Three-fifteen.
- Over there...

801
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:32,046
...in the residential part of the complex
should be a telegraph office.

802
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,591
Send this to Mycroft.
Be back here on the hour.

803
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:30,224
That's what you get, Mr. Holmes,
when industry marries arms.

804
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,601
Now put your gun down.

805
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,896
It's a bit old-fashioned.

806
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,569
What you need is one of these.

807
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,697
Go on.

808
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,034
Pick one.

809
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,832
Machine pistol, self-repeating.

810
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,003
Takes 7. 63 caliber rounds...

811
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,673
...in one of these.

812
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,761
A 10-shot box magazine.

813
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,391
- Easy enough to load.
- Hmm.

814
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,936
I'd imagine one would have to
retract the bolt to engage the first round.

815
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,855
Easier done than said.

816
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,825
Take him to the surgery.

817
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,579
I'll find the doctor.

818
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,925
"Come at once if convenient.

819
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:52,347
If inconvenient, come all the same. "

820
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,277
This is schnapps.

821
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,615
A telegram was sent from here.

822
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:14,828
This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit,
distilled from potato mash.

823
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,497
A common misconception.
Thank you, by the way.

824
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,292
Who was it sent to?

825
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,419
My horror at your crimes
is matched only...

826
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,505
...by my admiration at the skill
it took to achieve them.

827
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,800
Who was it sent to?

828
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,555
<i>You used the anarchists and
their bombs to create a crisis in Europe...</i>

829
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,182
<i>...nation against nation.</i>

830
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:39,102
Under various pseudonyms, you bought,
schemed, or murdered your way...

831
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,856
...into numerous industries, assuring
that none of it could be traced to you.

832
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:47,277
<i>Cotton, opium, steel,
now arms and chemical weaponry.</i>

833
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,697
<i>All to be shipped across Europe
in less than a week.</i>

834
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,075
<i>Everything from bullets to bandages.</i>

835
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,829
Now that you own the supply,
you intend to create the demand.

836
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,208
A world war.

837
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,506
<i>You are familiar with Schubert's work.</i>

838
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:16,139
<i>The Trout is perhaps my favorite.</i>

839
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:23,021
A fisherman grows weary of trying
to catch an elusive fish.

840
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,316
Out the way, out the way.

841
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,819
So he muddies the water.

842
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:30,946
I'm warning you.

843
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,906
Confuses the fish.

844
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:39,996
You were warned.

845
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:44,042
It doesn't realize until too late
that it has swum into a trap.

846
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,066
Let's try this again, shall we?

847
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:35,195
To whom did you send the telegram?

848
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:37,697
To my...

849
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,671
To my brother Mycroft.

850
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,509
What are you playing at?

851
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,849
That's not fair.

852
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,727
I've just got one more question for you.

853
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,944
Which one of us is the fisherman...

854
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,613
...and which the trout?

855
01:25:49,352 --> 01:25:50,478
Holmes?

856
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:53,857
- Holmes?
Unh.

857
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:57,360
Take your time. Take your time.

858
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:03,783
Uh...

859
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,000
Always good to see you, Watson.

860
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:29,142
- What were you thinking?
- Wait.

861
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,518
Wait?

862
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:36,608
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him right where I wanted him.

863
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,198
Right. Crack on, then.

864
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:50,622
Professor.

865
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,583
I'm all right, I'm all right.

866
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,461
Don't waste time attending to me.

867
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,385
I'll find them. I'll find them.

868
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,894
Turn in three, two, one.

869
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:22,654
Come on, hurry up!

870
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:28,201
Go!

871
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,505
Did you see my brother?
No, but I'm certain he's been here.

872
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,424
Where are we going?
- Over that wall.

873
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,009
- How did you know I'd find you?
You didn't find me.

874
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:47,011
You collapsed a building on me.

875
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,733
Where are the horses?
- They're behind.

876
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,319
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?

877
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,695
What's our way out?

878
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,238
That's our way out.

879
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,899
Go! Go!

880
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,027
Come on!

881
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,212
Marko! Marko!

882
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,098
He's not breathing.

883
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:33,900
Cradle his head.

884
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,152
Raise his legs.

885
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,656
Bloody well not gonna die on me.

886
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:47,455
I'm not gonna make this easy on you.

887
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:51,584
Come on. Come on.

888
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,419
Come on.

889
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,509
Come on.

890
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,886
I know you can hear me,
you selfish bastard.

891
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:03,971
Come on!

892
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,432
I know you can hear me, you bastard.

893
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:27,912
His wedding gift.

894
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,185
Terrible dream.

895
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,563
You, Mary, Gladstone
and I were in a restaurant.

896
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:56,774
That satanic pony was there as well,
a massive fork in his hoof...

897
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,901
...and he turned on me!

898
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:00,987
What have you administered?

899
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:02,947
Your wedding present.

900
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,366
Who's been dancing on my chest?!

901
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,826
Me.

902
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,287
Why is my ankle so itchy?

903
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:11,873
You have a large piece of wood
sticking out of it.

904
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,083
Good Lord. You, Tamas.

905
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,462
I have an important job to discuss
with you. Remind me of it later.

906
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,381
Sit down. Drink this.

907
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,134
I need to get that out before
it turns septic.

908
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:29,849
- Did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably.

909
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,602
Just leave it in. Leave it--!

910
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:37,565
You are a--

911
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,651
- Oh, you are some sort of--
- Be nice.

912
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,204
I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.

913
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,501
Me too.

914
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,343
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.

915
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,054
We're going home.

916
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:16,229
Via Switzerland.

917
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:22,610
What better place to start a war
than a peace summit?

918
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:28,991
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

919
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,969
I don't understand why you don't
cancel the summit.

920
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,554
Fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

921
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,807
Everyone has already arrived.

922
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,184
Although these gentlemen
may be talking peace...

923
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,770
...believe me, they're readying
their armies at home.

924
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,398
To cancel the summit now
would be tantamount to war.

925
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:03,901
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.

926
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,237
Oh, doubled security. That's comforting.

927
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,282
You don't understand the delicacy
of the situation.

928
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:11,325
I passed the telegram on
to my superiors.

929
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,204
But they brought Moriarty in to advise
on the peace process in the first place.

930
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:17,498
He has positioned himself brilliantly.

931
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,376
He's one of our foremost intellectuals,
a personal friend--

932
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,712
Of the prime minister.
Yes, we all know that.

933
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:25,715
I believe you, but where's your evidence?

934
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,719
He's too good to leave evidence.

935
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,262
He doesn't leave loose ends.

936
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,307
Oh, he's alive.

937
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:35,599
Sherly, put that down.

938
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,687
What is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating.

939
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:43,899
That's my private and personal supply
of oxygen, and you're not to touch it.

940
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,278
This argument is getting us nowhere.

941
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:51,365
I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

942
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,535
Stanley, Stanley.

943
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:59,081
You haven't aged a day.
Is that my favorite chutney?

944
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:02,251
Fact is, we don't really know
what he's planning.

945
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,588
It won't be another bomb.
No, it wouldn't be.

946
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:07,256
It doesn't make sense.

947
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:10,051
Why would he attack all the nations
only to unite them?

948
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:11,594
It'll be an assassination.

949
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,097
By a lone gunman at close range.

950
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:18,059
Rene.

951
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,186
Unfortunately, yes.

952
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,773
- You knew.
- I had my suspicions.

953
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,984
But having seen who would be attending,
I'm now certain.

954
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,820
Well, at least we know
who to look out for.

955
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:31,656
Rene will be the evidence.

956
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,534
If we can find him and stop him,
we will perhaps not only save his life...

957
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,829
...but prevent the collapse of
Western civilization.

958
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:41,040
No pressure.

959
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:15,699
Welcome, ambassador.

960
01:39:17,576 --> 01:39:19,870
Professor James Moriarty.

961
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,679
Now we're all present...

962
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:40,641
...I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador...

963
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,893
...the French prime minister and his man.

964
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:47,440
And the other nations are really working out
which side to take should hostilities erupt.

965
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:50,860
Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar,
and the Russian ambassador.

966
01:39:51,026 --> 01:39:53,821
The Archduke Karl Ludwig
and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.

967
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,283
The Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

968
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:00,870
And of course our prime minister
and the British ambassador.

969
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:04,915
He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries
are assembled, preferably standing still.

970
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,834
Is there to be an official photograph?

971
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,880
Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.

972
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:14,008
In which case, we might as well dance.

973
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,056
I've never done this before.

974
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:26,061
Just follow my lead.

975
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,494
- What do you see?
- Everything.

976
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,840
That is my curse.

977
01:40:56,258 --> 01:40:59,220
But you don't see
what you're looking for.

978
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,405
I thought you'd never ask.

979
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,993
Over my shoulder.

980
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:26,872
Young man, German uniform,
ceremonial sword.

981
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,582
Got him.

982
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,293
Professional opinion?

983
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,004
Trauma.

984
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,465
Major injury.

985
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:39,134
But excellent repair work.

986
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:42,263
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

987
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:45,766
<i>You did say he was at the
forefront of a medical innovation.</i>

988
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,519
<i>We've already seen an example
of his skills.</i>

989
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:52,898
Those twins weren't twins.

990
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,484
My suspicions were aroused
in Heilbronn...

991
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:59,029
<i>...when one failed to go to the aid
of the other.</i>

992
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:03,409
I also noticed the discreet but
unmistakable puckering behind the ear...

993
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:06,662
...where his skin had been drawn back.
I should've realized then...

994
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,707
...that they were a surgical experiment.

995
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:13,210
To see if it is possible
to make one man look like another.

996
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,713
<i>His face is no longer his own.</i>

997
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,884
What better way to guarantee his world war
than to make the assassin...

998
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:23,387
One of the ambassadors.

999
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:29,560
That narrows down the possibility
to one of six.

1000
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:33,230
You and Sim shall find her brother.

1001
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,566
- Of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes.

1002
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,818
You know my methods.

1003
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,572
And I know where you'll be.

1004
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,076
No possible solution could
be more congenial to me than this.

1005
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:49,580
By the way,
who taught you how to dance?

1006
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:51,707
You did.

1007
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:55,127
Well, I've done a fine job.

1008
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,255
Be careful.

1009
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:37,336
Shall we go to work?

1010
01:43:39,546 --> 01:43:43,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, gather for the portrait.

1011
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,353
I'm sorry.

1012
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,772
Is this a bad time?

1013
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,149
Never better.

1014
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:03,362
- Would you bring that clock?
- Heh.

1015
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,912
We get to play that game after all.

1016
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,844
Here we are.

1017
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:34,727
Don't want you to catch a cold.

1018
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:40,983
A five-minute game?

1019
01:44:42,025 --> 01:44:44,027
If you think you can manage it.

1020
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:06,633
We both have two bishops.

1021
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,595
I may be absent from the room,
but my methods are not.

1022
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:11,930
You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.

1023
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:15,350
That doesn't seem fair.

1024
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,943
Right. The surgery will have left scars.

1025
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:28,072
Only four of them have the hairline
to hide them.

1026
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,704
The ambassador that you replaced
with Rene, is he still alive?

1027
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:41,627
Would you like me to recommend
your next move?

1028
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:45,506
They're all my brother's height,
right build...

1029
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:47,466
...but their eyes.

1030
01:45:47,633 --> 01:45:50,302
Their eyes are wrong.
Rene has blue eyes.

1031
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:55,599
He could be wearing glass lenses
to change the color.

1032
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,603
In which case, his eyes will be hurting.

1033
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:03,774
Rene is left-handed.

1034
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,943
<i>Perhaps the assassin
will take measures...</i>

1035
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,237
<i>...to ensure he doesn't give himself away.</i>

1036
01:46:08,403 --> 01:46:09,947
Like a gambler concealing a tell.

1037
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,372
I think it might be him.

1038
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,791
You think?

1039
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,584
Your clock is ticking.

1040
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:23,794
You have to be sure.

1041
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:26,755
<i>May I remind you, this is blitz chess.</i>

1042
01:46:26,922 --> 01:46:29,758
<i>A single miscalculation
will cost you the game.</i>

1043
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:35,389
If I tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1044
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,016
<i>Maybe it's less obvious.</i>

1045
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:41,436
<i>A nervous tic. A flutter of anxiety.</i>

1046
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:44,481
I expect everyone has a reason
to be nervous tonight.

1047
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:51,530
I don't know.

1048
01:46:58,787 --> 01:47:00,706
<i>So perhaps it's the opposite:</i>

1049
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:03,041
<i>A failure to behave naturally.</i>

1050
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,503
<i>An actor so consumed
with his performance...</i>

1051
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,756
<i>...that the one characteristic
he cannot accommodate...</i>

1052
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,550
...is spontaneous reaction.

1053
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:05,145
Carruthers, protect the prime minister.

1054
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:16,740
Germany will pay! Mark my words!

1055
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,243
That doesn't bode well, does it?

1056
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:25,707
Seems your bishop
was of some benefit after all.

1057
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:27,292
The game is still young.

1058
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:29,503
Actually, it's in its adolescence.

1059
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,634
There are more of us!

1060
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,722
Germany will pay!

1061
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:51,358
No loose ends.

1062
01:48:56,571 --> 01:48:59,866
What happened to him?
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

1063
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:22,973
What happened?

1064
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,766
- Curare.
- What's wrong with him?

1065
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:26,143
It's poison.

1066
01:49:26,309 --> 01:49:27,978
Do something!

1067
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:33,900
Doctor, do something!

1068
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,319
No.

1069
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:56,214
I think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1070
01:49:56,965 --> 01:50:01,011
But a winning strategy
sometimes necessitates sacrifice.

1071
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:02,637
A war has been averted.

1072
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:05,223
Mm. Oh, I disagree.

1073
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:06,850
How so?

1074
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:11,146
Didn't you find it strange
that the telegram you sent...

1075
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:14,024
...didn't inspire any action to stop me?

1076
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:21,448
You see,
hidden within the unconscious...

1077
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,201
...is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1078
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:32,834
So you're not fighting me
so much as you are the human condition.

1079
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:38,256
All I want to do is own the bullets
and the bandages.

1080
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:43,637
War on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1081
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:47,224
They'll do it themselves
within a few years.

1082
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:52,187
All I have to do is wait.

1083
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,402
I like Switzerland.

1084
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:02,572
They respect a man's privacy here.

1085
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:05,742
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1086
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,293
Bishop takes knight. Check.

1087
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:17,921
The game is over.

1088
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,799
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1089
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:23,301
About that fortune of yours.

1090
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:28,598
I believe it's just
been substantially reduced.

1091
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:30,392
King to rook two.

1092
01:51:30,559 --> 01:51:32,435
I attended several of your lectures.

1093
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,355
The equations of motion,
which you will find in my book.

1094
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,525
The energy that is required
to release these explosions is...

1095
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:42,487
<i>It was in Oslo when I first caught
a glimpse of your little notebook...</i>

1096
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:45,031
...red leather-bound from
Smythson of Bond Street.

1097
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:48,702
Rook to king's rook three. Check.

1098
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:58,962
Bishop to rook three.

1099
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:01,673
Its importance was not fully
apparent to me...

1100
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,801
<i>...until I observed your penchant
for feeding pigeons.</i>

1101
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:08,889
Then it occurred
that with an empire so enormous...

1102
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:12,309
...even you must keep a record
of it somewhere.

1103
01:52:12,475 --> 01:52:13,852
Bishop takes bishop.

1104
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,104
Rook to bishop four.

1105
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:19,107
I then only required the notebook itself.

1106
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,692
<i>You didn't make it easy.</i>

1107
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:24,029
Just the bags.

1108
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,656
I would need to endure a considerable
amount of pain.

1109
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,076
Mycroft...

1110
01:52:31,077 --> 01:52:34,873
...care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

1111
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,169
But the notebook would undoubtedly be
encoded, so how then to break the code?

1112
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:42,631
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook.

1113
01:52:42,797 --> 01:52:44,591
Bishop to bishop seven.

1114
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:46,718
Queen takes knight pawn.

1115
01:52:46,885 --> 01:52:52,265
<i>Does The Art of Domestic Horticulture
mean anything to you?</i>

1116
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,894
<i>How could a man as meticulous as you
own such a book...</i>

1117
01:52:56,061 --> 01:53:00,148
...yet completely neglect the flowers
in his own window box? Irony abounds.

1118
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:08,281
Never mind, it's safe, in London...

1119
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:12,577
<i>...where my colleagues are making
good use of it.</i>

1120
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:17,707
<i>The most formidable criminal mind in
Europe has just had all his money stolen...</i>

1121
01:53:17,874 --> 01:53:22,420
...by perhaps the most inept inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1122
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,005
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1123
01:53:24,172 --> 01:53:26,841
Box 0403.

1124
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:29,886
Tick.
Box 0801.

1125
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:31,680
How much more is there?

1126
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:34,140
That's the end of page two.

1127
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:35,475
Page three.

1128
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:50,991
He'll be making an anonymous donation
to the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.

1129
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:54,536
Bishop to bishop eight. Discover check.

1130
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:57,330
And, incidentally, mate.

1131
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:04,296
I seem to have injured my shoulder.
Would you mind?

1132
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:11,761
Be my pleasure.

1133
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:18,560
Once we've concluded
our business here...

1134
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:21,229
...it's important you know...

1135
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:25,608
...I shall endeavor to find the most creative
of endings for the doctor.

1136
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,280
And his wife.

1137
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,995
<i>His advantage, my injury.</i>

1138
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:40,165
<i>My advantage, his rage.</i>

1139
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:46,421
<i>Incoming assault feral, but experienced.</i>

1140
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:49,507
<i>Use his momentum to counter.</i>

1141
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,848
<i>Come now.</i>

1142
01:54:57,349 --> 01:55:01,644
<i>You really think you're the only one
who can play this game.</i>

1143
01:55:01,811 --> 01:55:05,357
<i>Trap arm. Target weakness.</i>

1144
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,650
<i>Follow with haymaker.</i>

1145
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:10,779
<i>Ah. There we find
the boxing champion of Cambridge.</i>

1146
01:55:10,945 --> 01:55:13,323
<i>Competent, but predictable.</i>

1147
01:55:15,658 --> 01:55:18,536
<i>Now allow me to reply.</i>

1148
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:23,375
<i>Arsenal running dry. Adjust strategy.</i>

1149
01:55:27,504 --> 01:55:29,672
<i>Wound taking its toll.</i>

1150
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:34,302
<i>As I feared.
Injury makes defense untenable.</i>

1151
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:43,395
<i>Prognosis increasingly negative.</i>

1152
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:50,902
<i>Let's not waste any more
of one another's time.</i>

1153
01:55:55,782 --> 01:55:58,701
<i>We both know how this ends.</i>

1154
01:56:12,674 --> 01:56:14,884
<i>Conclusion, inevitable.</i>

1155
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:18,680
<i>Unless...</i>

1156
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:31,961
<i>A few words may suffice
to tell the little that remains.</i>

1157
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:44,474
<i>Any attempt at finding the bodies
was absolutely hopeless.</i>

1158
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:50,772
<i>And so there...</i>

1159
01:57:50,939 --> 01:57:56,861
<i>...deep down in that dreadful caldron
of swirling water and seething foam...</i>

1160
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:03,576
<i>...will lie for all time...</i>

1161
01:58:06,704 --> 01:58:09,165
<i>...the most dangerous criminal...</i>

1162
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:15,505
<i>...and the foremost champion of the law
of their generation.</i>

1163
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:23,888
<i>I shall ever regard him as the best...</i>

1164
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:32,855
<i>...and the wisest man whom
I have ever known.</i>

1165
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:34,691
John?

1166
01:58:37,235 --> 01:58:39,404
- John.
- Mm-hm.

1167
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:41,698
You should probably pack.

1168
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:42,907
It's half past 2...

1169
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:44,993
- ... and the carriage is coming at 4.
- Mm.

1170
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:48,746
It's gonna be a beautiful week
in Brighton.

1171
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:51,416
Yes, it'll be fun.

1172
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,376
I'm looking forward to it.

1173
01:58:55,545 --> 01:58:57,338
You know I miss him too...

1174
01:58:58,047 --> 01:58:59,716
...in my own way.

1175
01:59:06,889 --> 01:59:08,349
He would have wanted us to go.

1176
01:59:10,018 --> 01:59:12,854
He would have wanted to come with us.

1177
01:59:14,355 --> 01:59:16,691
When's Mrs. Hudson
coming for Gladstone?

1178
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:19,068
Oh, soon.

1179
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:22,780
Three o'clock.

1180
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:50,475
Mary?

1181
01:59:52,101 --> 01:59:54,187
Who delivered this parcel?

1182
01:59:54,354 --> 01:59:56,314
The postman.

1183
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:00,026
The usual chap or...

1184
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,237
...did he look peculiar?
